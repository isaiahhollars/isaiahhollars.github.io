Isaiah Hollars</h1>
<h5>
Mathematics Student (for the foreseeable future) </h5>
<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the University of South Carolina. I went to undergrad at Belmont University and Indiana University and majored in mathematics and minored in CS. 
    Outside of mathematics, I enjoy running, rec sports, and stragegy games of all kinds. </p>
<p>Below, I have links to my GitHub and Arxiv profiles. 
    My GitHub has various projects from undergrad, some more mathematical than others. On the Arxiv, I have one preprint that came out of the work done 
at the NYC Discrete Math REU in 2022. </p>
